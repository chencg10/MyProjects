# Logistic Regression for MNIST Classification

This repository contains a Python implementation of logistic regression for classifying images from the MNIST dataset.

The code utilizes the following libraries:
- `scipy` for loading the dataset from a `.mat` file
- `numpy` for numerical computations
- `matplotlib` for plotting loss and accuracy curves
- `scikit-learn` for splitting the dataset into train and test sets
- `tqdm` for displaying progress bars during training

## Features

- Loads the MNIST dataset from a `.mat` file.
- Implements logistic regression for binary classification of digits 1 and 2.
- Performs train-test split and trains the model using batch gradient descent.
- Calculates and plots the loss and accuracy curves during training.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Install the required libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
